Once again the results obtained from the LLM were subpar at best. I feel like the summarized issues sound a bit better than it did back in HW2 but that could be chalked up to randomness. The comparator did seem to be working better than last time in the sense of its output, for us, it did say "This is the summary of overlapping bugs between List A and List B. After comparing each bug in both lists, I found that none of the bugs are present in both lists simultaneously. Therefore, no overlapping bugs exist. The result is an empty array as per the instructions," which did not happen for us in HW2. However the bug finder was still not good, we still either got non existent bugs or broken responses. For that reason, I continue to say that no, the LLM could not detect any bug also reported as a GitHub Issue.
